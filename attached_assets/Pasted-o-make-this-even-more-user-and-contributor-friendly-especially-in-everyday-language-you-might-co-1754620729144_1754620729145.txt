o make this even more user- and contributor-friendly (especially in everyday language), you might consider:

Shortening some technical explanations (for a simple README)

Adding a quick “How to run locally” section (if sharing code)

Maybe a short feature roadmap or “What’s next?”

Here’s a refined/condensed README-style version in simple, everyday language, suitable for the top of your repo or a “project intro”:

Cozy Critter — Animal-Themed Mood Tracker
Cozy Critter is a neurodivergent-friendly mood tracking app that makes emotional self-care gentle, private, and fun.
Check in with adorable animal emoji, add your own notes, and get encouragement that really gets ND life. All your data stays on your device—no accounts, no cloud, no stress.

✨ Features
Animal emoji mood check-in
Choose the animal that matches how you feel today.

Optional notes
Write a quick note with any mood—useful for journaling, venting, or celebrating!

Custom encouragement
Get (or even create) affirmations tailored to neurodivergent needs: masking, stimming, executive function, sensory breaks, and more.

Mood history (“My Garden”)
Review your past moods and notes in a cozy visual timeline.

Full privacy
Data is saved only in your browser (localStorage). It never leaves your device.

Installable & offline
Works offline and can be added to your phone’s home screen as an app.

Accessibility built in
Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast, and respects motion preferences.

🛠️ Tech & Architecture
Frontend:
React (with TypeScript), Vite for fast dev/build, Tailwind CSS for cozy styles, shadcn/ui for accessible UI, and Wouter for simple page navigation.

State & Storage:
All moods/notes are stored locally in your browser. The app is ready for future features like user accounts, but you don’t need one now.

Backend (future-ready):
Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL for possible future login or sync—currently not required.

Accessibility & Design:
Uses Radix UI for solid ARIA and keyboard support, warm animal-friendly color palette, and responsive/mobile-first layouts.
