# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 8, 2025**

## The Simple Version

Cozy Critter is built privacy-first. **We don't collect, store, or share any of your personal data.** Everything stays on your device, always.

## What Data We Handle

**Mood Entries**
- Your mood selections (animal emoji choices)
- Optional notes you write
- Timestamps of your check-ins
- **Stored:** Only in your browser's local storage on your device

**Custom Messages**
- Encouragement messages you create
- **Stored:** Only in your browser's local storage on your device

**App Preferences**
- Theme preference (light/dark mode)
- **Stored:** Only in your browser's local storage on your device

## What We DON'T Do

âœ… **No data collection** - We never collect your mood data  
âœ… **No servers** - Your mood data never leaves your device  
âœ… **No accounts** - No sign-ups, no passwords, no tracking  
âœ… **No analytics** - We don't track how you use the app  
âœ… **No cookies** - No tracking cookies or persistent identifiers  
âœ… **No sharing** - We can't share what we don't have  
âœ… **No selling** - Your data isn't a product  

## How Your Data Stays Private

**Local Storage Only**
All your mood data is stored using your browser's localStorage feature. This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to other websites
- Is not synchronized to the cloud
- Can be deleted by you at any time

**No Network Requests**
Once the app loads, it works completely offline. Your mood data never makes any network requests.

**Complete Control**
You have total control over your data:
- View exactly what data exists in the Privacy tab
- See how much storage space is being used
- Delete everything instantly with one button
- Clear your browser data to remove everything

## Technical Stuff (For Developers)

**Open Source**
The entire codebase is open source. You can verify that no data collection happens by reading the code.

**Browser localStorage**
We use the standard browser localStorage API. Data is:
- Scoped to this app only
- Not shared across websites
- Cleared when you clear browser data
- Under your complete control

## Your Rights

**You own your data** - All mood entries and notes belong to you  
**Delete anytime** - Remove all data with one click  
**No lock-in** - Your data isn't trapped in any system  
**No accounts to delete** - Nothing to cancel or remove  

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy, we'll update this file and the "Last updated" date. Since we don't collect contact information, we can't notify you directly - but any changes will be visible here and in the app.

## Contact

If you have questions about privacy or this policy, you can:
- Open an issue on our GitHub repository
- Check the code yourself - it's all open source
- Use the data deletion feature to see privacy in action

## The Bottom Line

**Cozy Critter is designed so we literally cannot access your mood data, even if we wanted to.** Your privacy isn't just a promise - it's built into how the app works.

Your emotional wellbeing data is deeply personal. That's why it never leaves your device, never goes to any server, and is always under your complete control.
