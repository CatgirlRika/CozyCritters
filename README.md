# Cozy Critter v1.0.0 - Animal Themed Mood Tracker

**A complete, production-ready app designed specifically for neurodivergent folks.**

Cozy Critter is a gentle, private mood tracking app that actually understands ND life. No overwhelming interfaces, no judgment, no data harvesting - just you, cute animals, and a safe space to check in with your feelings.

Check in with adorable animal emoji, add your own notes when you want to, and get encouragement that really gets masking, sensory overwhelm, and executive function struggles. Everything stays on your device because your emotional data is deeply personal.

## 🎉 V1.0.0 - What's Ready Now

**This isn't a beta or "coming soon" - Cozy Critter v1 is complete and ready to be your daily mood companion.**

### Why V1 Matters for ND Folks:
- **No more waiting** - All features work right now, no "premium" barriers
- **Stable and reliable** - Won't break or change unexpectedly (we know how hard transitions are)
- **Actually finished** - Unlike many apps that promise accessibility "later," everything works today
- **Your feedback shaped this** - Built with real ND experiences in mind, not neurotypical assumptions

## ✨ What V1 Includes

### 🐾 **Animal Mood Check-ins**
Choose from adorable animal emoji that match your energy. No pressure to explain or justify - sometimes you just feel like a sleepy koala or an anxious rabbit, and that's perfectly valid.

### 📝 **Notes That Don't Judge** 
Add notes when you want to - never required. Great for:
- Venting about masking all day
- Celebrating small wins (did laundry = victory!)
- Processing sensory overwhelm
- Tracking what actually helps your mood

### 💚 **ND-Aware Encouragement**
Get affirmations that actually understand your world:
- "Your stimming is valid and helpful"
- "Masking is exhausting - you did great today"
- "Executive dysfunction isn't laziness"
- "Sensory breaks are self-care, not weakness"
Plus create your own personal encouragement messages.

### 🌸 **Your Personal Garden**
See your mood history in a gentle, visual timeline. No judgment, no "streaks" to maintain - just your authentic emotional journey displayed beautifully.

### 🛡️ **Privacy That's Actually Real**
Everything stays on YOUR device. We literally can't see your data even if we wanted to. One-click delete proves your control is real. No accounts, no tracking, no "anonymous" data collection lies.

### 📱 **Works Everywhere, Anytime**
- Install on your phone like a native app
- Works offline (because internet can be overwhelming)
- Accessible with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Respects your motion and contrast preferences

### 🎨 **Three Thoughtful Themes**
- **Light mode** - Clean and gentle
- **Dark mode** - Easy on sensitive eyes
- **Autism awareness** - Warm, calming golden tones created specifically for our community

## 🛠️ Tech & Architecture

**Frontend:**  
React (with TypeScript), Vite for fast dev/build, Tailwind CSS for cozy styles, shadcn/ui for accessible UI, and Wouter for simple page navigation.

**State & Storage:**  
All moods/notes are stored locally in your browser. The app is ready for future features like user accounts, but you don't need one now.

**Backend (future ready):**  
Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL for possible future login or sync. This is currently not required.

**Accessibility & Design:**  
Uses Radix UI for solid ARIA and keyboard support, warm animal friendly color palette, and responsive/mobile first layouts.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

**Start the dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# or  
yarn dev
```

**Open in your browser:**  
Usually at http://localhost:5173

## 🔐 Privacy Promise

- **No tracking, no accounts, no data collection**
- **Everything stays on your device** (browser localStorage)
- **One click delete everything** - prove your privacy is real
- **Works offline** - no internet required after first load

- Multiple theme options for different sensory needs
- No sudden animations or jarring transitions

### ♾️ **Stimming & Self-Regulation Support**
