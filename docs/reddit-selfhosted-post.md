**Title:** [Showcase] Cozy Critter – A privacy-first, offline, self-hostable mood tracker PWA

Hi r/selfhosted! I built Cozy Critter, a gentle, privacy-focused mood tracker web app.

**Features:**
- All data stays in your browser—no servers, no accounts, no tracking.
- Works offline (PWA).
- Simple self-hosting—just static files!
- Designed for neurodivergent folks.
- Open source, MIT license.

**Get it:** [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CatgirlRika/CozyCritters)

Try it out, self-host it, and let the community know what you think!
