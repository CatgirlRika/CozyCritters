# CMS Backend Security & Production Readiness Review

## Summary

- The CMS backend is **simple and accessible**, following a minimal approach with clear, maintainable code.
- No major security issues are apparent from code inspection.
- The build completes cleanly and the application starts without errors.
- For secure identifier generation, the backend uses `randomUUID` (see `cms/src/utils.ts`, lines 1–5), which is a strong, modern choice.
- An attempt to run `npm audit` was made, but resulted in a 403 error (likely due to private or restricted registry configuration). Manual dependency review may be needed.
- The codebase is minimal and internal in scope. While it appears accessible, a full assessment for neurodiversity-friendly (ND-friendly) status is not confirmed at this time.

## Code Reference

```typescript name=cms/src/utils.ts
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';

// Generates a secure, random UUID for entity IDs.
export function generateId() {
  return randomUUID();
}
```

## Testing Performed

- **Build:** `npm run build` — Succeeded without errors.
- **Start:** `npm start` — Application served and responded as expected.
- **Audit:** `npm audit` — Attempted, but returned 403 Forbidden. No automated vulnerability report was produced.

**Note:**  
While the CMS backend is internal and minimal, periodic manual reviews and dependency checks are advised to maintain security and accessibility best practices.
