# Mood and Color Customization

Cozy Critter lets you tailor mood options to match how **you** experience feelings. This guide offers a sensory-friendly way to adjust moods and their colors without editing files.

## Open the Mood Manager
1. From the home screen, choose **Moods**.
2. The manager lists every mood currently available.

## Add a Mood
1. Enter an emoji that represents the feeling.
2. Give the mood a short name.
3. Provide a Tailwind CSS color class (for high‑contrast, try `bg-green-600 text-white`).
4. Select **Add mood**. Your new mood appears immediately.

## Remove a Mood
- Select **Remove** next to a mood you no longer want.
- Built‑in moods are hidden instead of deleted so you can restore them later by clearing the hidden list.

## Accessibility Tips
- All fields have clear labels and can be reached with the keyboard.
- Use high‑contrast colors for better readability.
- Custom moods are stored only in your browser’s `localStorage`. Clearing site data resets them.
