# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Cozy Critter project pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, neurodivergence, communication style,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community that embraces neurodiversity and a
range of communication styles.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
* Allowing direct, literal communication without assuming rudeness
* Being mindful of sensory and accessibility needs, such as providing content
  warnings or allowing camera-off participation
* Asking for clarification when communication is unclear before assuming
  malicious intent

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate the reasons for their
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported using our anonymous form, by emailing the dedicated moderation team
at [will put real email ASAP], or by contacting the project team through GitHub
issues or discussions. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly. See the Moderation Policies section for details on how
reports are handled and what to expect from the process.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Moderation Policies

### Receiving Reports

Reports can be submitted through an anonymous online form or by emailing
[real email soon]. Direct messages through GitHub issues or discussions
are also monitored, but the dedicated channels ensure a prompt response.

### Moderator Roles and Escalation

Initial triage is handled by project moderators. Cases that require additional
attention are escalated to the lead maintainer and, if necessary, to the
steering group for final decisions.

### Response and Investigation

Reports are acknowledged within 48 hours. Moderators gather information,
interview those involved, and document findings. Investigations typically
conclude within 7 days unless additional time is communicated.

### Appeals and Mediation

Anyone subject to an enforcement action may request mediation or appeal the
decision. Accommodations for neurodivergent participants, such as written-only
communication or extended response times, will be honored whenever possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.
